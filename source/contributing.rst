Contributing
============

Discussions
-----------

The easiest way to contribute to the Working Group is by watching and engaging
in discussions hosted on our `Discussions repository`_.  This is where we discuss
starting new projects and direction of the working group or existing projects.

 .. _Discussions repository: https://github.com/python-http/discussions/issues


Contributing to Projects
------------------------

All projects listed within the `Projects`_ page are accepting contributions.
If you're new to Open Source or HTTP try looking for issues labeled "Good First Issue"
for issues that project maintainers have marked as being great starting points
for contributing to that specific project.
